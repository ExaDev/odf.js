// Takes an ORDERED array of [path, entry] tuples, not a Record, so the caller controls the exact emission order deterministically. This is what makes ODF's "mimetype" part -- which must be the very first byte-for-byte entry in the zip, stored uncompressed -- possible to guarantee: a Record's key order surviving a Zod parse/round trip (see model/package.ts's PackageSchema, which stores parts in a z.record) is not a guarantee this format's correctness can depend on, so package-io/write.ts builds this ordered array explicitly, with the mimetype part (and META-INF/manifest.xml, if present) hoisted to the front, before calling zipPackage. zipSync itself iterates a plain object's own string keys in insertion order (a JS-spec guarantee for non-integer-like keys), so building that object here, in the caller-supplied order, in a single synchronous pass, is what actually pins the resulting byte layout.
export function zipPackage(entries: readonly (readonly [string, ZipEntry])[]): Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer> {
  const data: Zippable = {};
  for (const [path, entry] of entries) {
    if (entry.stored === true) {
      data[path] = [entry.bytes, { level: 0 }];
    } else {
      data[path] = entry.bytes;
    }
  }
  return zipSync(data);
