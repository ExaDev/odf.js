// Resolves a Package into { metadata, pages }: office:drawing's own draw:page content model was verified structurally IDENTICAL to office:presentation's, against both the OASIS ODF schema (draw:page's own attribute/content-model definition is a single, format-agnostic schema fragment shared by both office:body children, not two separate definitions) and a real .odg file built via the LibreOffice UNO API -- document order is native here exactly like odp (a draw:page's own position among its office:drawing siblings IS page order, with nothing resolution-worthy above it), and the SAME draw:frame/draw:g/vector-primitive content-walking logic (readDrawPageContent, typed/draw/shapes.ts) and the SAME master-page -> page-layout size-resolution chain (resolveDrawPageSize, typed/shared/masterpage.ts) apply unchanged.
//
// FACTORING DECISION: what genuinely differs between odp and odg is not draw:page's own content model, but everything AROUND it -- odg has no presentation:notes concept and no slide-specific wrapper to build, while (per shapes.ts's own vector-primitive additions this module now also draws on) a drawing commonly carries bare vector-primitive shapes directly under draw:page/draw:g, something a presentation's own draw:page can equally carry per the schema but rarely does in real Impress output. Given that, the SHARED page-size chain and the SHARED content walk were each factored out into typed/shared/masterpage.ts and typed/draw/shapes.ts respectively (both now used verbatim by readOdpContent too -- see masterpage.ts's own top-of-file note), while this module's own thin readPage/readOdgContent wrapper is kept separate from readOdpContent's own readSlide/readOdpContent wrapper: forcing the two format-specific wrappers into one shared function would mean threading an odp-only "does this format have notes" branch through odg's own call sites for no shared benefit, since neither wrapper is more than a few lines of format-specific glue over already-shared machinery -- matching odt/read.ts's own precedent for when duplicating a small amount of glue beats an awkward shared abstraction.

Deliberately A4-based, matching readOdtContent's own fallback choice and reasoning (each reader's own fallback should reflect the format it actually reads) rather than reusing readOdpContent's own SLIDE_SIZE_WIDESCREEN, which is Impress's default, not Draw's.
