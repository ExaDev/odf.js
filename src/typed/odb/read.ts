// Package -> OdbInventory: connection info plus the NAMES of forms/queries/reports/tables in a .odb (application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.base) database front-end package -- never their content, and never the embedded/external database engine's own binary or script storage. This is deliberately NOT a typed content reader in the sense readOdtContent/readOdpContent/readOdsContent/readOdgContent are: a .odb's real "content" -- table rows, query result sets, form/report layout and logic -- lives either inside a real database engine (HSQLDB, Firebird, or an external server) this reader does not and will not parse, or inside each form's/report's own genuine ODF sub-document (a real, separately-readable office:document-content the existing readOdtContent-style machinery could open on its own merit, but which this reader deliberately never opens, matching the "never their content" mandate). HSQLDB/Firebird binary parsing is separate, later work in the documents.js repo, not here.
//
// EMPIRICALLY CONFIRMED against real, unmodified LibreOffice 26.2 output, not assumed: a headless UNO Basic macro (mirroring the same technique src/typed/odm/read.ts's own top-of-file note describes) created a real embedded-Firebird .odb via com.sun.star.sdb.DatabaseContext.createInstance() with URL "sdbc:embedded:firebird", two real tables via a live SQL connection (CREATE TABLE "Customers"/"Orders"), and one real query via the data source's own QueryDefinitions container -- then stored it and unzipped the result directly (src/typed/odb/fixtures/embedded-firebird.odb, checked in alongside this reader, never hand-edited afterwards). Three real findings from that inspection, all load-bearing for this reader's own design, and all genuine corrections to this reader's own design-phase assumptions (which, per the OASIS ODF 1.3 schema's own "Database Front-end Document" chapter table of contents, expected a separate database/connection.xml part):
//
// 1. There is NO separate database/connection.xml part at all in real output. office:database (ODF's own database-front-end root, one of office:body's own content alternatives alongside office:text/office:spreadsheet/etc. -- confirmed directly against the real OASIS ODF 1.3 RelaxNG schema's own office-body-content define) lives directly inside the package's ordinary top-level content.xml, wrapped in the exact same office:document-content/office:body shell every other odf.js typed reader already unwraps. This reader's own CONTENT_PART constant is therefore "content.xml", matching every other typed reader in this package, not a database-specific path.
// 2. The embedded database engine's own storage is a single opaque part under database/ (here, database/firebird.fbk -- a real Firebird backup file) with NO extension and a manifest:media-type of "" (empty) -- exactly the "extensionless, unclassifiable-by-extension" shape this reader's own design brief anticipated for HSQLDB's equivalent database/script text file (an older embedded engine LibreOffice still supports choosing explicitly; this session's own headless HSQLDB attempt hit an unrelated Java classloader fault specific to this sandboxed environment, which is why the genuine fixture ended up Firebird-backed instead). Neither shape needs special-casing here at all: this reader never classifies package parts by path or extension in the first place -- forms/reports are enumerated from content.xml's own db: registry (see below), so an opaque engine-storage part under database/ is simply never a candidate, whatever it is called.
// 3. Tables have NO manifest-listed ODF part of their own at all -- confirmed by this exact fixture, which has two genuine, live-created tables and precisely zero manifest entries anywhere under a "tables/" prefix. A real engine's own tables are invisible to the ODF package entirely; the only ODF-level places a table's own NAME can legitimately appear without reading the engine's own binary/script storage (explicitly out of scope) are two optional, inline content.xml elements: db:table-representations/db:table-representation (a user's own saved column-width/style customisation for a table they've already browsed in Base -- present only if the user did that) and db:schema-definition/db:table-definitions/db:table-definition (used by a flat-file-backed data source with no real engine behind it, to describe its own schema since nothing else can). Neither appears in this reader's own genuine fixture (a fresh, uncustomised two-table database), so this reader's own real-fixture test asserts an honestly empty tables array for that file, not a bug -- see readTableNames below and Fidelity-equivalent framing in this module's own test suite.
//
// FORMS/REPORTS, by contrast, genuinely are separate sub-document parts, registered in content.xml as db:forms/db:component and db:reports/db:component -- each carrying the component's own db:name alongside an xlink:href pointing at its ODF sub-document directory. A SECOND real fixture now grounds this end to end: src/typed/odb/fixtures/form-and-report.odb, a genuine embedded-Firebird .odb with a real SALES table (six rows), a real saved query, a real bound form, and a real Report Builder report, built via LibreOffice's own in-process UNO API and never hand-edited afterwards (see form.ts's and report.ts's own top-of-file notes for the exact structural findings each produced). Two findings from it are load-bearing HERE, and both are genuine corrections to what this reader previously did:
//
// A. A form's/report's sub-document directory is NOT named after the form/report. Real output stores them under an opaque PERSISTENT name -- "forms/Obj11", "reports/Obj11" (both Obj11: the counter is per-container, not global) -- while the user-visible name lives ONLY in content.xml's own db:component/@db:name. This reader used to derive form/report names from the manifest's own part paths, which on real output returns "Obj11" for both rather than "SalesForm"/"SalesByRegion". Names and hrefs are consequently now read from db:forms/db:reports themselves, the one place the real name exists at all, and OdbComponentInfo carries the href alongside the name so a caller can actually locate the sub-document (readOdbForm/readOdbReport both resolve through it). B. The generation approach that previously failed here is now known-good, and the recorded failure is worth keeping as the negative result it is: com.sun.star.sdb.application.XDocumentContainer's own no-argument createInstance() genuinely does return null. What works is the same call LibreOffice's OWN bundled Form Wizard makes (basic/FormWizard/FormWizard.xba) -- createInstanceWithArguments("com.sun.star.sdb.DocumentDefinition", { Name, Parent, URL }) against the form/report container, followed by insertByName -- where URL points at an already-saved standalone document to import (a form), or is empty with an added DocumentServiceName of "com.sun.star.report.ReportDefinition" (a report, whose component is then configured in place and stored via the DocumentDefinition's own store()).
//
// A db:component-collection (a real folder-like grouping Base offers for both forms and reports) is walked recursively, contributing only its db:component leaves -- never its own db:name, matching how db:query-collection is already treated below. A leaf's name is its own db:name verbatim, NOT a "Folder/Name"-style hierarchical path: the ODF registry itself stores no such composed form, and composing one would be this reader inventing a convention rather than reading one.
//
// QUERIES have no manifest part of their own either -- confirmed both by this reader's own real fixture (one query, CustomerList, present in content.xml's db:queries but nowhere in the manifest) and by the RNG schema itself: unlike db:component, db:query/db:query-collection carry no xlink:href at all, only an inline, mandatory db:command (the query's own SQL text) plus an optional db:escape-processing flag. Query definitions are read from content.xml's own db:queries/db:query (and nested db:query-collection) elements. A db:query-collection's OWN db:name (a folder-like grouping, not a runnable query) is never added to the result -- only the db:query leaves nested inside it are.
//
// POLICY CHANGE: this reader used to discard db:command entirely, on the grounds that it was query CONTENT rather than a NAME, matching the same "never their content" mandate this module's top-of-file note states for forms/reports/tables. That blanket treatment does not actually hold for a query the way it holds for a form/report: a form/report's real content is a genuine separate ODF sub-document (layout, script, the works) this reader deliberately never opens; a query's "content" is a single SQL string already sitting inline in content.xml, no sub-document read required to get it. The design work for Report Builder (rpt:) support found a concrete need for that string: a rpt:report's own data source references a query BY NAME, and there is no way to know what a report actually renders without the query's real command text alongside its name. db:command and db:escape-processing are consequently now read and returned via OdbQueryInfo; forms/reports/tables keep the original "name only" mandate unchanged, since their own content genuinely does live in a separate sub-document this reader still never opens.
//
// driverClass, present in this reader's own design brief's illustrative return shape, is deliberately never populated: a full read of the OASIS ODF 1.3 RelaxNG schema's entire db: namespace (every db-* define -- the real database/connection element vocabulary) turns up no driver-class-equivalent attribute anywhere. db:driver-settings carries db:system-driver-settings/db:base-dn/db:parameter-name-substitution/db:show-deleted/db:is-first-row-header-line, none of which name a JDBC driver class. Kept in OdbConnectionInfo's own type as optional -- matching src/typed/odm/read.ts's own OdmSection.inlineContent precedent, a field the design brief asked for and kept ready rather than dropped, in case a future ODF revision or a non-LibreOffice producer's own extension attribute does carry one -- but never set by this reader, since ODF itself has nowhere to source it from.
