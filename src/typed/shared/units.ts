// ODF measurement-unit conversion, the shared foundation every future odt/ods/odp/odg reader (and this package's own existing style-property parser) needs. Unlike OOXML's integer EMU/twip/half-point units, an ODF length is a physical-unit STRING directly in the XML -- style:page-layout-properties's fo:page-width="21.001cm", a paragraph's fo:margin-left="0.5in", fo:font-size="12pt" -- so parsing is the real job here, not just multiplying by a fixed factor. document-schema.js's own Box/PageSize/Margins schemas (and this package's StyleProperties) are all pt-based throughout, so "points" is this module's one canonical output/input unit.
//
// Every unit and conversion constant below was verified against real style:page-layout-properties/style:paragraph-properties/style:text-properties output from LibreOffice 26.2 (via `soffice --headless --convert-to odt/ods/ods` on hand-built fixtures, and directly from LibreOffice's own bundled .ott/.ots template packages under /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/Resources/template/**) and cross-checked against the OASIS ODF `length` datatype (datypic.com's ODF schema reference; pattern `-?(\d+(\.\d+)?|\.\d+)(cm|mm|in|pt|pc|px)`). Two things are easy to get wrong by guessing rather than checking:
// - pc (pica) is 12pt, not 6pt or 10pt -- the one of these six units most likely to be misremembered. This is a fixed, universal typographic constant (1 pica = 12 points, independent of ODF), not something LibreOffice-specific to verify further.
// - px has no natural "points per pixel" ratio of its own; ODF (like CSS) assumes the CSS reference pixel, 96px = 1in = 72pt, so 1px = 0.75pt. This is the same assumption properties.ts's own original parseLength established and this module now supersedes -- see this file's own test suite for the LibreOffice-round-trip evidence.
// - cm/mm/in/pt are exact physical-unit ratios (1in = 2.54cm = 25.4mm exactly, per the international yard-and-pound agreement since 1959; 1in = 72pt, the standard PostScript/DTP point this package's own model already uses throughout), not approximations.

export type LengthUnit = 'cm' | 'mm' | 'in' | 'pt' | 'pc' | 'px';

// ODF's `length` datatype: a (possibly negative, possibly fractional) number immediately followed by one of these six unit suffixes.

const POINTS_PER_INCH = 72; // The standard PostScript/DTP point -- exact by definition, not measured.
const POINTS_PER_PICA = 12; // 1 pica = 12 points -- a fixed typographic constant, independent of any physical unit system.
const CM_PER_INCH = 2.54; // Exact, per the international yard-and-pound agreement (1959).
const MM_PER_INCH = 25.4; // = CM_PER_INCH * 10, exact for the same reason.
