// ODF's draw:transform: a shape's rotation and position collapsed into a single attribute, e.g. draw:transform="rotate(0.5235987755982988) translate(3.528cm 3.528cm)" -- a space-separated list of transform functions, applied in DOCUMENT order (left to right) directly to the shape's own local geometry, one function at a time. Only rotate(<angle-in-radians>) and translate(<length> [<length>]) are modelled here (scale/skewX/skewY/matrix are valid per the OASIS grammar but not produced by any real presentation-shape rotation this package has verified against, and are silently skipped -- a documented, narrow scope boundary, not a silent one).
//
// The exact composition rule below (left-to-right application, each rotate() pivoting about whatever point the pipeline has reached so far, rotate(angle) rotating CLOCKWISE on screen for positive angle once translate is folded in) was reverse-engineered empirically, not assumed from SVG's own transform-list convention (which composes the OPPOSITE way -- rightmost function applied first): a shape was rotated by a known angle in a real LibreOffice-round-tripped .odp (rotate(pi/2) then rotate(pi/6), each combined with a known translate), rendered to PDF via `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf`, and its rendered pixel bounding box was measured and compared against every plausible composition-order/sign hypothesis. Only "apply functions left to right, rotate(theta) mapping a current point (x,y) to (x*cos(theta) + y*sin(theta), y*cos(theta) - x*sin(theta))" reproduced the measured geometry, for both test angles. See this package's own repository history (the commit introducing this file) for the verification method; re-deriving this from the OASIS spec text alone reliably gets the sign/order wrong, since the naive "rightmost-applied-first" SVG reading does not match what real ODF producers/consumers actually do.

Composed this way, a shape's own rotate()-then-translate() pivots about its own local top-left corner (the origin its untransformed svg:width/svg:height box is defined against) and lands wherever translate() then places that pivot -- see resolveOdfShapeGeometry below for how this gets turned into a center-pivoting frame+rotationDeg instead.

In the transform case, real ODF carries NO svg:x/svg:y at all (confirmed: draw:transform's translate() component replaces them entirely, verified against a real LibreOffice odp->odp round trip) -- svg:width/svg:height alone are still required, since a shape's SIZE is never itself part of draw:transform.
//
// The returned frame is always the shape's own UNROTATED box (top-left + size), centered under the transform's own rotation pivot, with rotationDeg the clockwise-on-screen degrees a renderer should apply ABOUT THE BOX'S OWN CENTER to reproduce the real geometry -- matching how ContentShape.rotationDeg is already used elsewhere in this package family (see ooxml.js's own pptx reader), even though ODF's own draw:transform pivots about the box's local top-left, not its center: the center point is computed by applying the SAME transform pipeline to the box's own local center (widthPt/2, heightPt/2) rather than its local origin, which is provably equivalent to a center-pivoting rotation for a rigid (rotation + translation only, no scale/skew) transform -- see this module's own commit history for the derivation.

// Composes an enclosing draw:g's own transform-function list onto an already-resolved child shape's geometry -- the group-flattening counterpart to resolveOdfShapeGeometry above, mirroring how OOXML's p:grpSp group-flattening composes a parent group's off/ext/chOff/chExt onto each child (see ooxml.js's src/typed/pptx/read.ts applyGroupTransform/composeGroupTransform), adapted to ODF's own model: unlike OOXML, a real ODF draw:g carries no chOff/chExt child-coordinate remapping at all (confirmed: a real LibreOffice-generated group's children carry their own literal, already-page-space svg:x/svg:y -- grouping is a purely logical/selection construct with no coordinate-space effect in practice), and a draw:g's own draw:transform is likewise not something LibreOffice's own Impress import currently honours on render (confirmed via a controlled round-trip render test: a hand-added draw:g/@draw:transform survives re-import/re-export as inert, unrendered XML). This function still implements composition for a group-level draw:transform when present -- it is valid per the OASIS schema, mirrors the OOXML sibling reader's own group-composition contract exactly as this package's own architecture requires, and protects against any OTHER real-world ODF producer that DOES emit or honour one; it is simply, per the evidence above, dead weight for LibreOffice's own output specifically.
